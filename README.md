# Star Wars Characters Analysis

This application is an interactive tool developed with **Shiny for Python** to explore and visualize data of characters from the Star Wars universe.

This project was created as part of the **First exercise: Shiny Tutorial** for the Data Visualization Course to familiarize ourselves with the concepts of Shiny and how to develop interactive applications using Python.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used, `star-wars.csv`, contains detailed information about Star Wars characters, including:

- **Name** (`name`)
- **Species** (`species`)
- **Height** in centimeters (`height`)
- **Mass** in kilograms (`mass`)
- **Homeworld** (`homeworld`)
- **Gender** (`sex`)

## Application Features

- **Interactive Filters**:
  - Select one or more **genders** to filter the characters.
  - Select one or more **species** to filter the characters.
  - Button to **reset filters** to the default view.

- **Visualizations and Statistics**:
  - **Visualize the distribution of genders by species** using an interactive bar chart.
  - Display the **total number of characters** based on the applied filters.
  - Calculate and display the **average height** of filtered characters.
  - Calculate and display the **average mass** of filtered characters.
  - **Interactive table** displaying detailed information about filtered characters.

## What You Can Do with the Application

- **Explore the Star Wars universe** by filtering characters by species and gender.
- **Analyze trends** in the data, such as gender distribution within each species.
- **Compare physical characteristics** like average height and mass across different groups of characters.
- **Interactively visualize data**, making it easier to understand and analyze the information.
